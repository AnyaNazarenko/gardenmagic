# About Me

I'm a member of the research staff at the Begun Center for Violence Prevention Research and Education at Case Western Reserve University. My research focuses primarily on the intersection between law enforcement and individuals with mental illness. I am currently the research coordinator for the City of Cleveland Police Co-Responder Program and a member of the Cleveland Division of Police Settlement Agreement Data Team.

When I'm not trying to solve real-world problems using data, I can frequently be found climbing at the New River Gorge, planting heirloom vegetables in my front yard garden, or hiking with my husband and three dogs.
