Here's my professional website, developed using Quarto. I've included:
- an "About Me" section
- a page listing the grants I work on professionally
- a page listing my reports/publications and conference presentations
- a blog

My first blog post documents my takeaways from reading Jeff Leek's "How to Be a Modern Scientist" and how I've implemented some of his ideas in my everyday life.

Jeff Leek's "How to Be a Modern Scientist" can be found on Leanpub at the following link: https://leanpub.com/modernscientist
